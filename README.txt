Instructions:

1. Please open the project folder and run a pyhton server, you can use the following command: 

	python3 -m http.server

2. Open your browser and type the address provided by the pyhton server (in most cases, localhost:8080), if this doesn't work try either 127.0.0.1:8000 or 0.0.0.0:8000.

3. If the layout appears to be too stacked and oversized you can use zoom (control + / control -) to resize the layout.

4. Enjoy!
